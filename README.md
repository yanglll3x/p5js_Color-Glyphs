### Color Glyphs

[Final]

This is my final showcase. I make the "zzz" emoji be my cover because it really cute.

My final result that is the hue controls lines, saturation controls the points and circles, and the lightness controls the basic shape. Because I design the lightness controls the basic shape, so there are an obvious contrast between the colors with distinct lightness.

[gradient and oddball]

I change the background color to make the hue lines looks obviously. And through by oddball mode. I make many adjustments. I adjusted the basic shape, hue lines is from very short length to long length. I also made saturation circles and points bigger. In the end, I add one more filled circle inside to make saturation obviously, the color of this circle based on the basic shape color, it will get darker and lighter when it has different saturation.

[random and edit]

The Hue part:
I use a for loop and if-else function to let hue slider controls the number of lines and the rotation of lines. And for rotation around itself, I also use the push(), translate() and pop() functions. The hardest thing in this part is design the lines going up not from one end, I want to always make these lines in the middle not one side. And for funny, I seperate the odd number lines and even number lines.

The lightness part:
The lightness controls the basic shape. I design the shape from big to small, then from small to big and back again. But it will have too many similar shapes although they have very different colors, so I add rotation here to make one more shape.

The Saturation part:
Although this part does not effect the shape, but it's really a challenge for me. It's so hard to get the effect I want. Now the number of points is going up with the saturation slider moving right and each position is random. And the number of circles is going down with the saturation slider moving right. The position and size are also random each time.

And the random is so special and I have to create many arrays to store these positions data, for the best result I want to achieve, I create the function below and call the function only I need it. I ask Phoebe for help and she taught me how to use .push to store a data into an array. And I also ask my friend for help and she taught me how to call the function and let random every point positions each time.

Finally, the result is good and all variables are finished. The hue controls the lines and rotation. The saturation controls the points and circles. And the lightness controls the shapes and size.

[Sketch]

This is my second sketch idea.
I designed 4 elements here, lines, planes, points and circles. I hope three sliders controls these elements separation and I will add rotation, scale or offset to make colours vary greatly.
And I also was going to add some random function.
